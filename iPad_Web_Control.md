## 📱 iPad Web Control

This chapter introduces the **first control mode** in the dropdown menu: **iPad Buttons Mode**. With this feature, you can use your iPad (or any device with a browser) to control the car easily using on-screen buttons — just like a remote control! 🚗✨

You’ll see:
- 🔼 Four directional buttons (Up, Down, Left, Right)
- 📷 A live camera stream from the car
- ⚠️ A warning box when the car gets too close to an obstacle
