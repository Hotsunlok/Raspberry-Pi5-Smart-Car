### 🧾 Why Raspberry Pi 5?

The **Raspberry Pi 5** is the brain of the entire smart car system. It handles:

* 🧠 Running Python code (Flask server, camera processing, motor control)
* 📶 Acting as a **Wi-Fi access point** for iPad control
* 📸 Streaming video from a USB webcam
* 🗣️ Handling voice and gesture recognition
* 🎮 Receiving input from external devices like a Nintendo Switch controller

Compared to older models, **Pi 5 offers faster CPU, more RAM**, and **USB 3.0**, which helps with better webcam and multitasking performance.
