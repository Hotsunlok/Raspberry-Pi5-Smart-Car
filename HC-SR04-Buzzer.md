## üß† HC-SR04 Distance Sensor + üîä Active Buzzer (Obstacle Detection)

This chapter gives you an overview of the hardware used for **obstacle detection** in your Raspberry Pi 5 car project.  
It combines two components:

üìè **HC-SR04 Distance Sensor**  
![HC-SR04 Component](assets/hc_sr04.jpg)

üîä **Active Buzzer**  
![Active Buzzer Component](assets/buzzer.jpg)

These two work together to detect nearby obstacles. When the car gets **too close (less than 20 cm)** to an object, the buzzer starts beeping and the **web interface shows a warning message**.

 üí° This feature is only available in:
 - `iPad Buttons` mode  
 - `Switch Controller` mode  
 
 ‚ùó  It is **disabled** in `Voice Control` and `Gesture Recognition` modes.

### üß† Obstacle Detection Logic

The code logic checks the distance using the sensor. If something is **closer than 20 cm**, the buzzer **beeps continuously**, and the **web interface displays "‚ö†Ô∏è Warning: Too Close!"** in the obstacle alert box.

```python
# --- GPIO Pin Definitions ---
TRIGGER_PIN = 16  # HC-SR04 Trigger
ECHO_PIN = 26     # HC-SR04 Echo
BUZZER_PIN = 6    # Active Buzzer

# --- Initialize GPIO Zero Devices ---
distance_sensor = DistanceSensor(echo=ECHO_PIN, trigger=TRIGGER_PIN, max_distance=4)
buzzer = DigitalOutputDevice(BUZZER_PIN)

def obstacle_detection_thread():
    global obstacle_warning
    while True:
        if obstacle_detection_active:
            distance = distance_sensor.distance * 100  # Convert to cm
            if distance < 20:
                buzzer.on()  # Buzzer keeps beeping
                obstacle_warning = True
            else:
                buzzer.off()
                obstacle_warning = False
        else:
            buzzer.off()
            obstacle_warning = False
        time.sleep(0.1)
```
